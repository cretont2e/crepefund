I want to redo the website in the following way:

1. Change the style of the site.
   - Change the color scheme of the page to the one I used in gst.crepe.fund
   - Change the font and its sizes to the one I used in gst.crepe.fund
   - Change the layout to the one I used in gst.crepe.fund

2. In the "Navigation"
   - Leave the buttons "About" and "Docs" the same. 
   - Add a button to "Blog" and connect it to "https://medium.com/@CrepeFund".
   - Add a button to "GST" and connect it to "https://gst.crepe.fund".
   - Add another button "Staking", and connect it to "https://app.crepe.fund/staking/"
   - Add another button "under development" and make a pulldown menu with options "Crypto ETF", "Index", and "Lagrangian. Protocol". They must be connected to "under Construction" page to "https://crepe.fund/UnderConstruction". It means the "under Construction" page should be created.


3. In the hero section, change the phrase "Manage All The Assets On Earth" to "Prepare the Coming World of Cryto ETF and Stablecoins". The paragraph and the buttons below should stay the same.

4. As for "Why Crepe" Section, its content  should stay the same. 

5. As for "Status" Section, its content should stay the same.

6. As for "Applications" Section, the content must be deleted. 

7. As for "CREPE Index Board" Section, it should stay the same.

8. As for "Team" Section,
   - Change the size of the images of the team members to the same unique size. 
   - Add the team member "Nick Lee" to the team. With the following information:
     - Name: Nick Lee
     - Position: CTO
     - Image: Nick-Lee.jpg
     - Career: 
     - CEO at Crepe, Inc. 
       Professor at Konkuk University,      
     - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/youngwhan-nick-lee-71a89217/

9. As for "Partners" Section, its content should stay the same.

10. As for "Footer" Section, its content should stay the same.

## Deployment (2025-09-03)

- SSH configured for GitHub account `cretont2e` in WSL.
  - Key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_cretont2e` (added to GitHub).
  - SSH config alias `github.com-cretont2e` with `IdentitiesOnly yes`.
  - Repo remote set to `git@github.com-cretont2e:cretont2e/crepefund.git`.
- Pushed to `main`; Vercel auto-deployed using minimal `vercel.json` (static headers only).
- Production domain: https://crepe.fund

## Remaining Loose Ends

- Provide `images/team/Nick-Lee.jpg` (or adjust path) to avoid a broken image.
- Typos to optionally fix:
  - `index.html` hero: “Cryto” → “Crypto”.
  - `UnderConstruction.html` message: “Consruction” → “Construction”.
- Vercel project hygiene:
  - Ensure Automatic Deployments are ON and GitHub App authorized for this repo.
- Optional code cleanup:
  - Remove `index.php` if unused (avoid PHP detection).
- Optional UX:
  - Add a mobile-friendly dropdown toggle for small screens.
- Optional theme polish:
  - Fine-tune typography/spacing to match gst.crepe.fund more closely.
- Docs cleanup:
  - Update `README.md` to reflect a static site on Vercel (current README mentions WordPress migration).
